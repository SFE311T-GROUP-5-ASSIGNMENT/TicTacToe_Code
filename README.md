# Code_1
# This program code is a text-based game of tic-tac-toe. Tic-tac-toe or noughts and
crosses is a game where two players take turns marking an empty cell in a 3 x
3 grid with their respective tokens. Each player has either an X token or an O
token. A player wins whenever they place three of their tokens in a horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal row on the grid. A draw occurs when all the cells on the
grid have been filled with tokens and neither player has won.
